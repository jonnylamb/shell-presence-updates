shell-presence-updates extension
================================

I wrote this because in GNOME Shell 3.10 support was removed for updating your
IM presence when the session went to idle (see d802416dae) and I wanted this
functionality back. It turns out all extensions get disabled when we hit the
lock screen anyway so this can't be fixed in an extension. Shame.

Anyway as a result I had this half working extension with no future,
so I thought I'd put it online in case there's a way to get it working
at some point. I didn't want to write yet another daemon but I guess
that's what I'm going to be doing.
